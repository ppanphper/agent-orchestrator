// macOS still points at the .zip on purpose. The .dmg first-install artifact is
// built by frontend/makers/maker-dmg.ts, but no published release carries it yet,
// so flipping these two links (and the two macOS rows in README.md) to
// "...-darwin-{arch}.dmg" would 404 until a real release publishes both formats.
// That flip is rollout step 6 in issue #3267 and must happen only after a real
// release has been cut and the dmg verified. The .zip keeps publishing forever
// either way, because electron-updater cannot auto-update from a .dmg.
