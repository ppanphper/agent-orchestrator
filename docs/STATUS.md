# agent-orchestrator status

Current `main` ships a working single-user local loop: the Go daemon and the
Electron/React frontend both drive a live daemon over HTTP/SSE/WebSocket. The
core GitHub flow works end-to-end: add project → spawn session/orchestrator →
attach terminal → observe PR → merge.

This file tracks progress. For what the product _is_ and how to run it, see the
top-level [`README.md`](../README.md); for the backend mental model see
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Build & test

The local gate is the backend Go build and race-enabled test suite:

```bash
cd backend && go build ./... && go test -race ./...
```

`npm run lint` (from the repo root) runs `go test ./...` plus golangci-lint.
Frontend checks live under `frontend/` (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`).
See [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for the regen workflow when touching the API
surface (`npm run sqlc`, `npm run api`).

## Shipped

### Backend (Go daemon)

- Loopback-only HTTP daemon (chi router, CORS, per-request timeout,
  `/healthz` / `/readyz` / `/shutdown`).
- SQLite store with goose migrations and sqlc-generated queries; DB
  trigger-based change-data-capture into `change_log`.
- CDC poller + broadcaster feeding in-process subscribers and the SSE stream
  at `GET /api/v1/events` (with `Last-Event-ID` replay).
- Full session lifecycle over HTTP: list, get, spawn, kill, restore, rename,
  rollback, cleanup, send, activity, PR claim/list. Orchestrator routes
  (list/spawn/get) are wired too.
- Project CRUD plus per-project config (`PUT /projects/{id}/config`).
- PR action engine wired into the API: `POST /prs/{id}/merge` and
  `/prs/{id}/resolve-comments`.
- Review routes registered: `GET /reviews`, `POST /reviews/execute`,
  `POST /reviews/{id}/send`.
- Durable dashboard notifications for `needs_input`, `ready_to_merge`,
  `pr_merged`, and `pr_closed_unmerged`: backend enrichment/persistence,
  cursor-paginated read/unread history, live notification stream, and read
  acknowledgement API.
- SCM observer (`internal/observe/scm`) wired into the daemon: GitHub provider,
  lazy/non-blocking auth, per-PR polling with ETag guards and semantic diffing,
  feeding PR facts into lifecycle, which sends agent nudges for CI failures,
  review feedback, and merge conflicts
  ([#75](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/75),
  [#108](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/108),
  [#109](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/109)).
- Terminal mux over WebSocket (`/mux`): per-client `tmux attach` PTY on
  Darwin/Linux; conpty loopback pty-host on Windows.
- Lifecycle reducer plus reaper (`internal/observe/reaper`).
- Agent adapter platform under `internal/adapters/agent/` (23 adapters) with a
  registry and `ao hooks` activity dispatch.
- OpenAPI spec generated from Go DTOs; frontend TS types generated from it and
  drift-checked in CI.

### Frontend (Electron + React)

- Electron + React 19 + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind + shadcn primitives.
- Target-isolated per-session browser-control spike: a dedicated local
  daemon↔Electron bridge drives only the selected session's `WebContentsView`
  through Electron's bound debugger transport. `ao browser` supports open,
  compact accessibility snapshots and refs, click/fill/type, keyboard input,
  hover and non-mutating element highlighting, scrolling, selection and checked
  state, property reads, stable logical tabs and captured popups, a compact
  user-facing tab selector for switching/closing tabs and popup notices, waits,
  including load/disappearance/DOM-stability conditions, screenshots, console
  messages, page errors, and explicit temporary network-metadata capture while
  the Browser panel is hidden. Network capture is off by default, tab-scoped,
  bounded, automatically expires, and omits bodies and sensitive values. Tabs
  within one worker share an ephemeral Electron profile; different workers
  have isolated cookies and web storage. The toolbar activity signal is scoped
  to actual agent browser commands; annotation progress is separate and its
  successful-delivery confirmation clears automatically.
- Preview targets are explicit: `ao preview`, `ao preview <target>`, or
  `ao preview start` selects what the panel shows. The desktop poller no longer
  auto-discovers a static entry point merely because a fresh worker exists.
- Real daemon wiring via the generated `openapi-fetch` typed client
  (`src/api/schema.ts`); mock data only in `VITE_NO_ELECTRON` web-preview mode.
- Electron main handles daemon discovery, launch, and status reporting.
- Shell: sidebar (projects + sessions, add/remove project), sessions board,
  session view + inspector, project settings, pull-requests page,
  spawn-orchestrator flow.
- Desktop status and SCM summary V1: session status comes from
  `GET /api/v1/sessions`; visible/active PR context comes from
  `GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/pr`; `GET /api/v1/events` is kept open as
  an invalidation stream rather than a full PR payload stream.
- Concise PR summaries include PR identity, CI state with failing check names
  and links, human reviewer IDs/counts/links for unresolved review comments,
  and mergeability reasons. Raw CI logs and review comment bodies are
  intentionally not part of the desktop V1 API/UI.
- Terminal pane (xterm) over the mux WebSocket, with a live SSE events
  connection and port-rebind on daemon restart.
- In-app notification center with click access, Unread/All filters, paginated
  REST catch-up, live notification stream updates, separate PR/session target
  actions, persistent read history, mark-read controls, and Electron app toasts
  while the app is running.

## In flight / not yet a runtime feature

- **Tracker lane**: GitHub tracker adapter exists, but there is no daemon
  observer loop or agent-lifecycle→issue mirroring yet, so the tracker does
  nothing at runtime ([#112](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/112)).
- **Full raw PR/tracker fact surfacing**: the SCM observer writes facts and the
  desktop consumes concise PR summaries, but exposing the full raw `pr_*` /
  `tracker_*` CDC events to live consumers
  ([#110](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/110)) and in
  `ao session get` ([#111](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/111))
  is still open.

Tracking milestone:
[`rewrite`](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/milestone/1).
